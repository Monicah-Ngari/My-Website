        <p>
          Hello I'm Monicah Ngari, a front-end development specialist and
          enthusiastic web developer. With a solid background in HTML, CSS,
          Bootsrap, Tailwind, JavaScript, React and React Native, I build
          user-friendly, dynamic websites that are interactive and responsive. I
          know how to integrate APIs, work with Linux, and make sure that apps
          are reliable and effective by using tools like Postman. In order to
          stay ahead of the always changing web development industry, I thrive
          on finding solutions to challenging challenges and constantly learning
          new technologies. I enjoy learning about new technology trends,
          contributing to open-source projects, and honing my ability to provide
          meaningful and creative solutions when I'm not coding
