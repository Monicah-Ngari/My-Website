          digital experiences. I specialize in building modern, responsive, and

            {" "}
            HTML, CSS,Bootstrap,Tailwind, JavaScript, React, GraphQL and React
            Native
          </strong>{" "}
          . With hands-on experience in API integration, state management, Linux
          environments, and tools like Postman, I thrive in developing
          applications that are not only functional but also optimized for
          performance and accessibility. I enjoy solving complex problems,
          refining UI/UX interactions, and ensuring seamless user experiences
          across different platforms. Beyond coding, I stay actively engaged in
          exploring emerging technologies, contributing to open-source projects,
          and continuously enhancing my expertise in modern web development. I
          am always eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals, embrace
          new challenges, and push the boundaries of what’s possible in tech.
          When I’m not immersed in code, I enjoy tech blogging, participating in
          hackathons, and staying updated on the latest industry trends to drive
          innovation.
