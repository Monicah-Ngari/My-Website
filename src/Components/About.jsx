        <p>
          Hello I'm Monicah Ngari, a front-end development specialist and
          enthusiastic web developer. With a solid background in HTML, CSS,
          Bootsrap, JavaScript, and React, I build user-friendly, dynamic
          websites that are interactive and responsive. I know how to integrate
          APIs, work with Linux, and make sure that apps are reliable and
          effective by using tools like Postman. In order to stay ahead of the
          always changing web development industry, I thrive on finding
          solutions to challenging challenges and constantly learning new
          technologies. I enjoy learning about new technology trends,
          contributing to open-source projects, and honing my ability to provide
          meaningful and creative solutions when I'm not coding
