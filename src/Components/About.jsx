        <p>
          I'm Monicah Ngari, a front-end developer passionate about bringing
          ideas to life through compelling web experiences. My core skills
          include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and React Native, enabling me to
          build dynamic, responsive websites and applications that are both
          visually appealing and functionally robust. I have practical
          experience integrating APIs, working within Linux environments, and
          using tools like Postman to ensure seamless performance. I'm a
          problem-solver at heart, always seeking opportunities to learn and
          grow within the ever-evolving world of web development. When I'm not
          coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends and contributing to the
          open-source community.
