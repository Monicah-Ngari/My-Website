      <h1> About Me</h1>
      Hello I'm Monicah Ngari, a front-end development specialist and
      enthusiastic web developer. With a solid background in HTML, CSS,
      Bootsrap, JavaScript, and React, I build user-friendly, dynamic websites
      that are interactive and responsive. I know how to integrate APIs, work
      with Linux, and make sure that apps are reliable and effective by using
      tools like Postman. In order to stay ahead of the always changing web
      development industry, I thrive on finding solutions to challenging
      challenges and constantly learning new technologies. I enjoy learning
      about new technology trends, contributing to open-source projects, and
      honing my ability to provide meaningful and creative solutions when I'm
      not coding.
